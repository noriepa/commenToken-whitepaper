<h3>Abstract</h3>

The cryptoeconomy and web 3.0 are simply not the same as the waves of innovation that came before. We are now thoroughly into the networked era, yet people are still building the future with the past. Web 2.0 companies, build, find product-market fit, then extract or in friendlier terms, find a problem, solve it and either charge money or accrue value via user data. Web 3.0 enables a framework to emerge directly to a community who then decides what will be done.

Bringing the verbiage of famous start-up pitches like Uber for X and Airbnb for Y and Stripe for Z will continue to work even as they reach the cryptoeconomy and "true" cyberspace, but not for long. It stands to reason that many would like to bring this model of thinking with them, but in places where tools have names like sushi and pancake in their name or where irrational (as if irrational is a bad thing you sill geese) memes dominate over logical solutions this seems unlikely to last. This new realm of existence does not care about the last 100 years of 'science' and 'logic', only [tbd].

_commenTokens_ explicitly enable the possibilities of web 3.0 (by association of being a commenToken) as one/many can inject cultural commentary (read: a meme) into the internet and allow the forces of reality to determine what the specific release of said cryptopossibility will become. Surgery on a grape instead of moonshot promises.

commenTokens take the premise of web 3.0 and stretch it to a (non) ultimate conclusion. Why does te creator or founder know how something will be? Upon releasing a painting or a car in the past, yes. Similarly, in the past the news or a gallery curator would share the thing you should know about. But with interactivity and network dynamics we will see a melding of the creator, the founder, the consumer, the curator and the cureator emerges. This means cryptoprojects can take on a more improvisational mode of development. In other words, crowdfunding and community development can take a commenToken and its initial marketing/copywriting and immediately participate with vested financial and social incentive to develop and create (as compared to early users of Apple or Tesla who can only buy the product and talk about it). 

It might also be necessary to create a classification system within commenTokens, to help push cryptopossibilities in certain directions or encourage  a potential way to frame what one is looking at upon first encounter. Our first commenToken $RUGPULL is classified as a joken for obvious reasons to anyone who is familiar with altcoin seasons. 

In order to lead ahead of where it will end up the joken $RUGPULL must be launched before its whitepaper is finished, so as to only guide possibility and not determine undeliverable promises. What does the future hold?
