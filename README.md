<h3>Abstract</h3>

The cryptoeconomy and web 3.0 are simply not the same as the waves of innovation that came before. We are now thoroughly into the networked era, yet still at a point in time in which people are building the future with the past. One area this is explicitly seen is in company launches. Web 2.0 built then extracted or in friendlier terms, found a problem and solved it. Once it finds the right community, it begins to seek higher and higher revenue. Web 3.0 enables a framework to emerge directly to a community who then decides what will be done.

Bringing the verbiage of famous start-up pitches of Uber for X and Airbnb for Y and Stripe for Z will continue to work even as they reach the cryptoeconomy and "true" cyberspace. It stands to reason that many would like to bring this model of thinking into places where tools have names like sushi and pancake in their name or where irrational (as if irrational is a bad thing you sill geese) memes dominate over logical solutions. But this new realm of existence does not care about the last 100 years of 'science' and 'logic', only [tbd].

_commenTokens_ explicitly enable (by association of being a commenToken) one/many to inject cultural commentary (read: a meme) into the internet and allow the forces of reality to determine what the specific release of said cryptopossibility will become. This is truly surgery on a grape.

It might also be necessary to create a classification system within commenTokens, to help push cryptopossibilities in certain directions or encourage  a potential way to frame what one is looking at upon first encounter. Our first commenToken $RUGPULL is classified as a joken for obvious reasons to anyone who is familiar with altcoin seasons. 

To be continued...
